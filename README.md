# stock_picker
This project is to create a Ruby method that determines the best days to buy and sell stocks based on an array of prices.
(As an added bonus, there is also a method to generate an array of random stock prices to test the picker with.)
This project was made as an exercise for [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/ruby-stock-picker).
